# 📚 Computer Organization and Architecture

This repository is dedicated to tracking and organizing my progress in studying **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)**. The goal is to develop a strong understanding of how computers work at the hardware and system level.

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of digital logic and data representation.
- Learn about CPU architecture, memory hierarchy, and I/O systems.
- Grasp the principles of pipelining, instruction set architectures (ISA), and control units.
- Explore parallelism, cache design, and modern computer design strategies.
